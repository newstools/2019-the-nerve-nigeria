The largest individual producer of gold from South Africa, Sibanye-Stillwater has launched a formal process to restructure its unprofitable gold mines and this could cost about  6,670 their jobs. The South African miner said it had entered into consultation with stakeholders on restructuring its gold operations following financial losses at its Beatrix 1 and Driefontein 2,6,7,8 shafts in 2018. The restructuring could affect about 5,870 employees and 800 contractors as Sibanye employs over 61,000 people in its gold and platinum mines in South Africa. Before the restructuring plans, the company was hit by a three-month strike at its gold mines. The strike was led by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) on November 21, 2018, to demand a wage increase of R1,000 a month, ($70.18). Meanwhile, the company’s spokesperson, James Wellsted stated that the restructuring is not directly related to the strike. “We’ve been talking to the unions at monthly ‘future forum’ meetings about this matter, so it’s not new and not directly as a result of the strike. The strike has meant that we’ve not had the unions coming forward to suggest ways to resolve the problems the way they did at Beatrix a few years ago,” said Wellsted. In January, Sibanye said its 2018 bullion production narrowed to R1 billion for the 12 months to end-December from R4.4 billion a year earlier,  despite plans being implemented to curb losses after workers downed tools in mid-November. The company also noted that its full-year loss narrowed because of stronger prices for its platinum group metals (PGMs) that were offset by losses at the gold operations. It will report full-year results on February 21 when  Sibanye-Stillwater Chief Executive Neal Froneman will elaborate on the impact of the strike on the gold business.
