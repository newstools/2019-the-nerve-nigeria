Zimbabwe’s former minister of finance and opposition leader, Tendai Biti has been convicted and fined $200 for unlawfully and falsely announcing the results of last year’s presidential election which was won by current president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Magistrate Gloria Takundwa of a Zimbabwe court ordered Biti to pay $200 or go to prison for a week. He was also handed a jail term of six months, which was suspended for five years. According to AFP, leader of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Nelson Chamisa, who was in court, said the conviction “casts a very dark shadow on our politics”. Last year Biti, the vice chairman of MDC proclaimed his party leader Nelson Chamisa the winner of the July 30 poll which sparked anti-government protests killing six people. This saw Biti flee the country to Zambia for asylum but he was later deported by Zambian authorities sparking international rage. However, the international community has urged Mnangagwa to guarantee the safety of Biti, who was the internationally-respected finance minister in Zimbabwe’s 2009-2013 power-sharing government. According to Reuters, Chamisa said Biti was being persecuted for telling the truth and that the former finance minister was one of many MDC leaders being targeted by Mnangagwa’s government in a bid to cripple the opposition, but the government has denied the charge. When Robert Mugabe was ousted by Mnangagwa in a coup last year, a lot of people thought it was going to be a new dispensation that would usher hope to the citizens from the tyrannical rule of Mugabe but unfortunately, nothing seems to have changed.
