In spite of the notable improvements in GDP, economic growth still remains weak in Nigeria, with growth averaging under 2.5 percent which is comparable to the rate of population growth over the next five years. Inflation in the country, especially of food prices, remains high. There is also a high rate of unemployment and insecurity in the country. According to a recent report by Brookings, unless policymakers implement significant reforms to reduce dependence on oil economies like Nigeria remain at risk of a lost decade (flat per capita GDP). The IMF also warned that to diversify its economy in order to boost revenue which will help unlock private credit and improve corporate performance.
