French oil major Total plans its biggest exploration campaign in years for 2019 and has disclosed it intends to drill 23 wells in waters off South Africa, Mauritania, Senegal, Namibia, Guyana and Brazil. Total Exploration and Production Southern Africa is carrying out its deep sea stavenger rig operations in Western Cape, the South African province whose coasts border the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The country’s Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe says the operations should boost investor confidence and contribute positively to the economy. “If we can discover oil and gas here, that will be a game changer for the country in terms of the economy. We hope that we will discover oil so that we can reduce our dependence on imported crude oil,” Mantashe said on Saturday when he led a delegation from the Department of Mineral Resources to the Total exploration site situated 180km off the shore of Mossel Bay. “We will work with other government departments in giving the project all the support we can, because we believe that it will help support a turnaround in our economy,” he said. Total had announced in January that the company was dumping its focus on “frontier” areas that have not been commercially exploited in favour of areas known to contain commercial levels of oil or gas, as the former strategy had yielded little result. “We were spending a lot of money in frontier. Now we want balance,” Kevin McLachlan, Total’s senior vice president for exploration, told Reuters.
