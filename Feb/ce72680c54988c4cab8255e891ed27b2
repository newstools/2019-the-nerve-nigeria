Multinational telecoms operator VEON Ltd plans to offer £5.30 ($0.3005) per share for the 42.3 percent (1,997,639,608 shares) of Cairo-listed Global Telecom Holding (GTH) it does not already own, in line with previously announced plan to take GTH private. The offer is a 16 percent premium to GTH’s £4.57 closing price on Monday and will amount to about $600.5 million. VEON will deposit a public mandatory cash tender offer (MTO) with the Egyptian Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 12 of the Executive Regulations of the Egyptian Capital Market Law No. 95 of 1992. Amsterdam based VEON had last year announced plans to simplify the Group’s operating model. It, therefore, embarked on “a comprehensive review to ensure VEON’s HQ is an effective, efficient organisation”, especially as it supports its operating companies in emerging markets. In January, the company said it was addressing its strategic relationship with GTH, formerly Orascom Telecom, and was considering taking the company private. VEON operates telecommunications companies in developing countries in Asia and North Africa. It also operates in Russia. VEON said in a statement that it has not submitted the offer to the FRA and will therefore is unable to comment further on the deal. However, it says the offer will reach the Egyptian financial authorities within 60 calendar days. GTH’s shares grew 4.16 percent in mid-day trading on Tuesday on news of the deal.
