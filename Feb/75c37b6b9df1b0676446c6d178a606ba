When Zimbambwe needed a loan from South Africa, the economic big brother could not help, as it said it was not in a financial position to do so at the time. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube had said in January, that Zimbabwe was looking everywhere to get bailout loans as the country finds its way out of its worst economic crisis in a decade. With loans from regional partners not forthcoming, Zimbambwe was hoping to approach three private-sector credit providers that will give the country a couple of credit facilities of about $500 million. Now, Botswana has also offered to lend the Southern African country $600 million to support its diamond industry and local private firms, state-owned newspaper Herald reported on Tuesday. The loan will consist of $500 million dollars for Zimbabwe’s diamond industry and a further $100 million to help private companies, whose operations have been crippled by a severe dollar crunch, the state-owned Herald newspaper said. Zimbabwe’s diamond sector has struggled since 2016 when the government kicked out private companies from the eastern Marange fields for refusing to merge under the state-owned mining company. Although details on the loan are yet to be made public, James Manzou, Zimbabwe’s secretary for foreign affairs said President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi would sign the loan agreements in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city on Thursday.
