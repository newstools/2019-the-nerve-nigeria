Exxaro Resources Limited has committed R20 billion ($1.5 billion) to the South African mining industry. Mxolisi Mgojo, CEO of the South African miner who spoke at the South African Mining Investment Roundtable which took place in Cape Town, said the investment would cover 2018 to 2022. This comes as the South African government continues to encourage value addition in the local mining industry. In 2017, the mining industry contributed 8 percent to South Africa’s GDP, but historically, it has contributed more, accounting for 21 percent of GDP in 1980. Hence, the government has continued to prioritize investment in the industry, as well as mineral beneficiation in order to grow its economy and create jobs. “The beneficiation of our minerals is one of the most critical issues that we as a government have prioritised because value addition will go a long way in creating jobs and growing our economy,” Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said. The event was hosted by the departments of Trade and Industry, Mineral Resources and Brand South Africa as part of measures to provide potential investors with the opportunity to interact with the country’s political and business leadership. According to Davis, the beneficiation of minerals is an important aspect of value addition as South Africa can no longer afford to export raw minerals to be beneficiated in other countries. To encourage value addition, the ministry has been engaged in various initiatives such as the development of hydrogen fuel cell-powered buses and vanadium batteries. The Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said the deepening of stakeholder relations between government, business, labour and communities, and the Mining Charter will go a long way to provide policy certainty for the industry.
