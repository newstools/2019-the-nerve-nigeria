The launch of a satellite by Rwanda is underway, as the country plans to launch its first satellite for research this year. In May 2018, Rwanda signed a Space Inclusion in Africa agreement with Japan to start training Rwandan engineers in fabricating local satellites in big data, weather and space technology. The agreement is part of a Japan-Africa program to train satellite engineers, to provide required information and date in different areas, starting with Rwanda. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are in collaboration with the Rwandan government to make the satellite launch a success. This was made known by Rwanda Utility and Regulatory Authority (RURA). According to the Director General of RURA, Patrick Nyirishema, “We are trying to shorten the timeline. It will be launched after the Transform Africa summit.” Transform Africa is an annual event hosted in Kigali that explores developments in technology. This year it will be hosted in May. Having a satellite in the orbit is considered a big leap in technological development and Rwanda is soon to join South Africa, Angola and nine other countries in Africa that have already launched a satellite.
