Kenya’s Treasury Secretary Henry Rotich has always said that the country’s Sh5.276 trillion ($52.7 billion) public debt, about 53 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) as at December 2018, is sustainable. But the director of research and planning at the Office of the Controller of Budget (CoB) Joshua Musimi is worried that the debt is getting into unsustainable levels. “With Sh1.1 trillion going into servicing debt, it will leave Treasury with less than Sh700 billion for expenditure which is unsustainable. Senate should ask the Exchequer to rethink its fiscal policy to avert a crisis,” Musimi said in his presentation to the Senate Finance Committee Thursday. The Treasury’s projection is to spend Sh1.1 trillion on debt repayment in the 2019/20 financial year starting in July. This amounts to 61 percent of the total projected tax collection of Sh1.87 trillion. Policy analysts are concerned about Kenya’s public debt, but Treasury insists it will only become unsustainable if it hits 70 percent of GDP. However, in the 2019 medium-term debt management strategy, the Treasury secretary Henry Rotich proposed a cutback on foreign loans, which currently stands at Sh2.6 trillion, to ease the repayment fears. Kenyans, each holding a debt of $1,033, while producing only $1,469, are already bearing the brunt of public debt repayment, with expenditure on development by counties and State agencies frozen by the Treasury, which is striving to honour debt obligations.
