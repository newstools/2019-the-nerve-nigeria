The International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) has signed a $154 million Financing Agreement with the Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG), to finance the imports of natural gas. Tunisia’s annual electricity consumption in 2014 was approximately 3 GWh, 95 percent of which was generated by natural gas, according to the country’s Ministry of Energy. However, the country does not produce enough to satisfy national demand, hence it imports needed natural gas from Algeria. “ITFC strives to develop it relationship further with Tunisia through providing trade integrated solutions to support its strategic sectors. This signing is a stepping stone towards signifying our cooperation and partnership with the Tunisian Government, which in turn contributes to the country’s Sustainable Development Plans,” said  Eng. Hani Salem Sonbol, CEO ITFC, who signed the agreement with Zied Ladhari, Tunisia’s Minister of Development, Investment and International Cooperation. Ladhari stressed the importance of financing to help secure the natural gas needs of STEG to produce electricity and for domestic consumption in response to the necessary energy needs in Tunisia. STEG owns exclusive rights to market and distribute Tunisian gas and electricity. Tunisia is also seeking to attract about $2 billion in foreign investment to produce 1,900 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy in three years, reducing its reliance on natural gas to power the country. The agreement with ITFC is part of the framework agreement adopted at the Annual Meeting of the Islamic Development Bank Group in Tunis in 2018, on the financing of the needs of national strategic commodity institutions for the period 2018-2020 with a total amount of $1.5 billion for the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company, the Tunisian Steel Manufacturing Company and the Tunisian Company for Refining Industries and the Central Pharmacy.
