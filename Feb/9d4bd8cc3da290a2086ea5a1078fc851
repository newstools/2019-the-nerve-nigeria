Ethiopia and Djibouti have signed a deal to build a 765-kilometre pipeline to transport gas from the landlocked state to Djibouti, partly bordered by the red sea. The 700 kilometers pipeline will be installed in Ethiopian Territory while 65 kilometers will be within Djibouti territory. The deal comes more than 40 years after Ethiopia found extensive gas deposits in its south eastern Ogaden Basin. Exploration activities in the basin were carried out by a number of international companies during the last four to five decades. From 1955-1991, 46 wells were drilled with numerous hydrocarbon shows and two gas/condensate discoveries, Calub and Hilala Last year, the country awarded production of Calub gas for the Chinese company Poly -GCL Petroleum Ltd. The company has been developing the Calub and Hilala fields since signing a production sharing deal with Ethiopia in 2013.
When completed in 2020, the pipeline will enable Ethiopia sell its gas resource from Calub and Hilala fields via Djibouti Port. Calub and Hilala fields have deposits of 4.7 trillion cubic feet of gas and 13.6 million barrels of associated liquids The agreement between Ethiopia and Djibouti comes more than a year after POLY-GCL signed a memorandum of understanding with Djibouti to invest $4 billion to build the natural gas pipeline, a liquefaction plant and an export terminal to be located in Damerjog, near the countryâ€™s border with Somalia.
Ethiopia hopes to earn $8 billion a year once it starts exporting natural gas at full capacity.
