2018 was a torrid time for motorists and consumers in South Africa, who battled rising fuel prices. The price per litre of petrol increased by nearly R4 across board. Unfortunately, the trying times caused by the fuel hike has extended to 2019 and is predicted to extend further into March 2019. The month of February is barely getting to half but with the numbers, it is never too early to predict the month of March’s fuel prices and the month of March is already looking bleak. From the mid-month data released by the Central Energy Fund, it seems inevitable that motorists will be facing a much higher hike rate than February’s 7 cent increase for petrol. The data which was averaged out for the month of February predict a 42 cents increase per litre for petrol and a 59 cents per litre for diesel. The amount may seem small because it is in cents but when accumulated it would be discovered that the money can be channelled to other things. This week alone, South Africa has seen daily price deficits of over 50 cents a litre and some days there were 80 cents deficits. Should this continue, the price of petrol would increase beyond 55 cents by the end of February. International oil prices and a swing in the Rand/US dollar exchange rate combined contribute to the fuel increase prediction for March. On Thursday, February 14, the rand broke through the R14 to the dollar mark, depreciating from R13.30 at the beginning of the month. Since the beginning of February, the price of oil price has been floating around $64 a barrel.
