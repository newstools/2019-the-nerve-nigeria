Mozambique and the Comoros Islands will receive $13 million in emergency funds from the United Nations, to help provide food and water and repair damage to infrastructure, after southern Africa suffered the second cyclone in a month. Cyclone Kenneth rammed into the northern province of Mozambique on Thursday as it continued its recovery from Cyclone Idai that hit its fourth largest city last month before moving into Zimbabwe and Malawi, killing more than 1,000 people. Kenneth hit the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado late on Thursday, flattening entire villages with winds of up to 280 kph (174 mph), as it unleashed heavy rains and flooding that has seen rivers overflow their banks. According  to World Bank estimates, Mozambique and other countries affected by the tropical storm will need over $2 billion to recover. Apart from infrastructural damage, Mozambique also faces a cholera epidemic which hit after Cyclone Idai wiped out water and sanitation facilities. “This new allocation of Central Emergency Response Fund funds will help humanitarian partners to scale up the response to address the needs of those most vulnerable in the aftermath of Cyclone Kenneth,” said UN Humanitarian Chief Mark Lowcock in a statement.
