The New Development Bank (NDB), formerly referred to as the BRICS Development Bank has approved funding of $790 million for three South African projects. According to the President of the bank, Kundapur Vaman Kamath, who spoke at the bank’s annual meeting in Cape Town, NDB plans to approve development financing amounting to $2.3 billion in South Africa by the end of the year. The NDB, established by the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), also signed a $180 million loan agreement for Renewable Energy Integration and Transmission Augmentation Project with Eskom. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that $480 million of the $790 million funding was for Eskom’s Medupi coal-fired power plant. Under the NDB’s project finance facility (PFF) agreement, the bank will provide a loan with a sovereign guarantee to Eskom. It will also support renewable energy development and reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuel as well as integrate a total of 670 MW of renewable energy into the Eskom’s grid. Calib Cassim, CFO of Eskom noted that, “The successful conclusion of this inaugural transaction with NDB will significantly contribute towards driving Eskom’s goals to reduce South Africa’s CO2 emissions.” The loan agreement was signed by Xian Zhu, NDB Vice
President and Chief Operations Officer (COO), and Calib Cassim, Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) of Eskom, during the 4th Annual Meeting of the New Development
Bank in Cape Town, South Africa.
