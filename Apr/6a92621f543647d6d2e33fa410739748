Moroccan energy utility Neo Themis has signed a partnership with Kingline Development Nigeria Limited (Kingline) to build a $600 million natural gas-fired power plant in Nigeria’s Ondo State Industrial Park in the Western part of the country, about 200km northeast of Lagos. The proposed 550MW facility is set to become one of the
world’s lowest cost natural gas-fired power plants and will provide 4.5TWh of
secure, affordable energy when it becomes fully operational in 2022. Currently,
Nigeria has 4,000 MW of operational capacity, compared to 13,400 MW of
installed capacity and 15,000 MW of demand. According to Tas Anvaripour, CEO of Neo Themis, “Kingline
offers compelling advantages for the Federal Government of Nigeria given its
extremely competitive pricing, availability of peripheral gas and transmission
infrastructure, timing to operation, and technical flexibility.” Funding will be provided by “multilateral and private institutions” led by Denham Capital, a global Energy and Resources Private Equity Firm Investing in Oil & Gas, Power and Mining with offices in Houston, London, Boston, and Perth. According to Denham, the project price was underpinned by an Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) agreement signed with an “international contractor that has successfully delivered over 4GW of gas-fired power plants in Africa,” although it did not say which. Neo Themis was set up in 2018 under a partnership between Themis and Denham Capital, acting through its International Power Fund, to launch the Africa Power Investment Platform. Since Neo Themis was set up in Morocco, Denham Capital has vowed to earmark $250 million for the development of energy projects in Africa. “Despite increased competition, the number of projects reaching closing is still largely below the needs of the continent, and this new venture is well positioned to fill the gap,” Tas Anvaripour had said in 2018.
