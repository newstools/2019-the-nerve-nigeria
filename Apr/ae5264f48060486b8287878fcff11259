In a bid to capitalise on the hot United States market for initial public offering (IPO), which expects to see a flurry of tech companies go public, social media web and mobile application company, Pinterest, is seeking to raise $1.28 billion in IPO. A move that could value the company below the amount it reached in its last private valuation. The value of the company has been increasing steadily over the years, rising to $12.3 billion in 2017, after raising $150 million in its last private funding.  The Wall Street Journal in February 2019, stated that Pinterest secretly filed for an IPO and the total valuation of the company at the time was $12 billion. However, if Pinterest successfully raises the planned 1.28 billion, the value of the company would drop. In May 2012, Pinterest was valued at $1.5 billion, by February 2013, it rose to $2.5 billion, reaching a $3.8 billion valuation in October 2013. The following year, the U.S headquartered company was valued at $5 billion. 2015 saw its value increase to $11 billion, to the extent that Fortune Magazine listed Pinterest its Unicorn List. According to a filing on Monday, April 8, Pinterest, which operates a software system designed to discover information on the World Wide Web, using images Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and videos, is offering 75-million shares for $15 to $17 apiece. Bloomberg noted that there is a likelihood of Pinterest’s fully diluted value going higher, however, given the total number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding after the offering, if the company is priced at the top of the range, Pinterest would have a market valuation of about $9 billion. Pinterest, which acts as a digital scrapbook, earlier revealed that it generated about $756 million in revenue from online advertisements in 2018, a 60 percent growth rate from 2017. The company’s net loss shrank to $63 million in 2018 from $130 million in 2017.
