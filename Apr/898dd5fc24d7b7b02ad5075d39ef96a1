Kenya has signed three more trade agreements with China, relating to infrastructure development that will open up markets and training opportunities. On his third visit to China in just eight months, President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Chinese counterpart/host Xi Jinping on Thursday witnessed the signing of three key agreements by Kenya’s Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya and Chinese foreign minister at the Chinese Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The two countries sealed deals on economic and technical cooperation and the protocol on sanitary requirements to allow Nairobi to export Hass avocados,  a cultivar of avocado with dark green-coloured, bumpy skin. A memorandum of understanding on joint promotion of the economic and trade measures of the eight key initiatives under the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), a three-yearly conference organised by Beijing to leverage its influence on the continent, was also signed. Under President Kenyatta, China has signed at least 20 agreements and memorandum of understandings, majority of which border around science, wildlife and environmental cooperation, financial settlement, infrastructure and trade improvement and are worth billions of dollars. China  has become a major financier of key infrastructure projects in the East African country. Currently, Kenya’s public debt is about $50 billion of which 72 percent is owed to China.
