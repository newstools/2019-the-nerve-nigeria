Sub-Saharan African investment banking fees reached an estimated $93.5 million during the first quarter of 2019, 24 percent less than the value recorded during the same period in 2018 and the lowest first quarter total in 5 years, announced Refinitiv, one of the world’s largest providers of financial markets data and infrastructure, in its Sub-Saharan Africa Investment Banking Review for Q1 2019. According to the report, Citi earned the most investment banking fees in Sub-Saharan Africa during the first quarter of 2019, a total of $16.5 million or a 17.6 percent share of the total fee pool. Total fees earned from completed Merger & Acquisition (M&A) transactions in the first quarter of 2019 equalled $36.9 million, a 31 percent increase on the amount earned during the same period last year. Syndicated lending fees increased 20 percent year-on-year to $30.1 million. However, equity capital markets underwriting dropped by 70 percent to a 2-year low of $11.6 million, while fees from debt capital markets underwriting fell 53 percent to a 3-year low of $14.0 million. M&A fees accounted for 39 percent of the overall Sub-Saharan African investment banking fee pool during the first quarter of 2019, with Equity and Debt capital markets generating 12 percent and 15 percent, respectively, while syndicated lending fees accounted for 33 percent. Deals involving a Sub-Saharan African target increased 71 percent in value to $6.0 billion, driven by Naspers’ $5.1 billion spin-off of its pay-TV unit MultiChoice which now trades on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The value of announced M&A transactions with any Sub-Saharan African involvement reached $8.8 billion during the first quarter of 2019, up 41 percent from the same period last year. Inbound M&A, involving an acquirer from outside SSA, was down 81 percent year-on-year to a 16-year low of $540.1 million, while outbound M&A increased 24 percent to an 8-year high of $2.2 billion. South Africa’s overseas acquisitions accounted for 57 percent of Sub-Saharan African outbound M&A activity, while acquisitions by companies headquartered in Mauritius accounted for 43 percent. Equity Capital Markets (ECM) in SSA were not at their best in Q1 2019, with equity and equity-related issuance totalling $1.1 billion during the period, 61 percent less than the value recorded during the same period in 2018. Eight follow-on offerings across the continent amounted to $1 billion, making up 98 percent of total ECM activity in SSA in Q1 2019, with the only IPO by Icon Properties in Malawi, accounting for the remaining 2 percent. The property development and management firm raised $20.4 million on the Malawi Stock Exchange in January. While Citi topped the M&A League table with 71 percent market share, Standard Bank Group topped the SSA ECM league table in Q1 2019 with a 49 percent share of the market. Many analysts have predicted a good year for the African Debt Capital Market (DCM), but the first quarter of the year did not show much promise in SSA, where debt issuance totalled $5.9 billion, down 52 percent from the value recorded during the same period in 2018. It is also the lowest first quarter total since 2016. Ghana and Ivory Coast were the most active issuer nations in Q1 2019 with $3.0 billion and US$1.2 billion in bond proceeds, respectively. Ghana raised $3.0 billion with its Eurobond issue in March, the largest bond offering in the region so far during 2019, which was eight times oversubscribed, supporting analysts’ prediction of a good 2019 for African debt markets. JP Morgan held 16 percent market share in this space in Q1 2019 to take the top spot in the Sub-Saharan African bond ranking, with $944.4 million of related proceeds.
