The government of KwaZulu-Natal will, Tuesday, officially open a furniture manufacturing plant, specialising in building coffins at the province which recorded the highest number of murders in 2017/18 – at 4,382, the third highest rate in South Africa (39.4 percent), behind Eastern and Western Cape. According to KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Member of the Executive Council Sihle Zikalala, the factory has created more than 600 jobs and has provided training to 10,000 emerging furniture builders. Funeral is big business in South Africa. The funeral industry generates about R10 billion ($706 million) in revenue every year, with the average cost of a funeral growing to over R40,000 for more than 460,000 South Africans who die annually. As funeral costs rise, more South Africans are taking up funeral insurance to cover the cost of essentials such as coffins, whose prices are rising as a result of growing demand, especially in places like KwaZulu-Natal which recorded more than 4,000 deaths from murder alone in 2017/18. The new plant will exploit opportunities that the expanding funeral industry offers. Zikalala said the plant will not only produce affordable coffins, but also an assortment of timber products sold out to a diverse clientele. “This unique factory uses timber cuts from alien invasive trees. It is therefore part of our Invasive Alien Species Programme aimed at eradicating invasive plants that are harmful to the environment,” Zikalala said ahead of the launch of the plant at Cedara Agricultural College in Howick, Pietermaritzburg.
