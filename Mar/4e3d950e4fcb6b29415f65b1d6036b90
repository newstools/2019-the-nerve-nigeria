A total of $985 million borrowed from some African banks is not enough for Zimbabwe to purchase fuel and other critical imports, with forex reserves now as low as $500 million. The southern African state whose battle to save its economy has just been hit by a further U.S. sanction has, therefore, permitted mining companies and other businesses to import their own fuel. “Cabinet has given a green light to large companies such as those in the mining sector, transport sector, commerce to use their funds to import fuel for their use,” Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa told reporters on Tuesday after a weekly cabinet meeting. President Emmerson Mnangagwa in January announced a 150 percent hike in the price of fuel, sparking violent protests which were matched with security crackdown. The government had said that the increase which made the country’s fuel price the most expensive in the world  was expected to tackle a shortfall caused by increased fuel usage and illegal trading. Despite that, long queues are yet to disappear but the government now hopes that allowing companies to buy their own fuel would ease pressure on demand for dollars. At a time of dollar shortage, the central bank still provides about $100 million a month to fuel companies for importation. Leading miners such as Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum Holdings, among others, are expected to be able to import their own fuel.
