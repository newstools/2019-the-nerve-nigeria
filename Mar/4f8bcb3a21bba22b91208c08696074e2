Shares of South African telecommunications provider, Blue Label, dropped to the lowest since 2009 following a disappointing interim result for the six months to November.  The company, which distributes prepaid electricity and airtime, reported a loss of R105m ($7.44 million) for the six months to end-November on Thursday, with its share of losses from its subsidiary Cell C amounting to R123m ($ 85.10 million). Cell C, witnessed a loss of R635 million in the half year to November. In 2017, Blue Label led acquired Cell C for R5.5 billion ($389.66 million) but since then, Cell C has struggled with debt and the dominance of larger rivals, Vodacom Group Ltd. and MTN Group Ltd. Cell C knocked R1.05 billion ($75 million) off Blue Label’s first-half core headline earnings and the shares fell as much as 21 percent, dragged lower by a 22 percent decline in prepaid airtime and data sales. Blue Label has a 45 percent stake in the mobile operator. Following the negative result, Cell C appointed a new interim
executive, Douglas Stevenson to lead the struggling company’s strategy of
improving network quality and coverage. “Douglas has a proven track record in
successful planning, execution and negotiation at various organizational levels
and we believe he will add tremendous value to the Cell C leadership team,” the
company noted. To bolster Cell C’S balance sheet, Blue Label said Buffer consortium led by South African billionaire property mogul Jonathan Beare had agreed to acquire a minority stake in Cell C.
