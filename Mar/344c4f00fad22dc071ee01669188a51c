The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has maintained the repurchase rate (repo) at 6.75 percent after it assessed overall risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less evenly balanced. Consumer inflation rose slightly to 4.1 percent in February from 4 percent in January, remaining within SARB’s target range of 3–6 percent. “Key upside risks are rising administered prices, including electricity and water tariffs, rising domestic food prices in the outer years and higher international oil prices,” Governor Lesetja Kganyago told reporters on Thursday. Kganyago said the downside risks include lower global inflation and an extended period of monetary accommodation in advanced economies. According to the governor, SARB will continue to focus its monetary policy actions on anchoring inflation expectations closer to the mid-point of the inflation target, in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. “The MPC is of the view that there is little evidence of demand side pressures in the economy. Over the medium term, cost-push factors could arise from higher electricity, fuel and food prices.” The approach of the MPC is to focus on the possible second-round effects of supply side shocks. Any future policy adjustments will continue to be data dependent, the governor said.
