Ethiopian authorities, Sunday, said that initial analysis of the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that killed 157 people showed “clear similarities” with last year’s Lion Air crash. “It was the same case with the Indonesian (Lion Air) one. There were clear similarities between the two crashes so far,” Ethiopian transport ministry spokesman Muse Yiheyis told Reuters. “The data was successfully recovered. Both the American team and our (Ethiopian) team validated it,” he said. He added that the Ethiopian Transport Ministry would provide more information in the coming days. Both Ethiopian and Lion Air planes were Boeing 737 MAX 8 and crashed minutes after take-off following flight control problems reported by their pilots. The disaster has led aviation authorities around the world to ground the model, which is the best selling passenger plane at the moment. Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg expressed the company’s continued support for the investigation into the cause of Ethiopian Airlines crash. According to him, Boeing is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available. “Safety is our highest priority as we design, build and support our airplanes. As part of our standard practice following any accident, we examine our aircraft design and operation, and when appropriate, institute product updates to further improve safety,” Muilenburg  said. “While investigators continue to work to establish definitive conclusions, Boeing is finalizing its development of a previously-announced software update and pilot training revision that will address the MCAS [Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System] flight control law’s behavior in response to erroneous sensor inputs.  We also continue to provide technical assistance at the request of and under the direction of the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Accredited Representative working with Ethiopian investigators.”
