South Africa’s economy grew for the second quarter in a row in the fourth quarter of 2018 following a recession in the second quarter of the same year when the economy contracted by 0.7 percent. The GDP had increased by 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2018, taking the country out of recession. The country’s GDP expanded by 1.4 percent due in part to growth in agriculture, transport and manufacturing, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) announced on Tuesday. Other major contributing sectors, according to  Joe de Beer Stats SA’s deputy director-general in charge of economic statistics, finance, personal services and electricity also contributed to South Africa’s economic growth in Q4 2018. He, however, noted that mining, trade, construction and government services contributed negatively to the GDP. De Beer said the manufacturing industry expanded by 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter, while the finance, real estate and business services increased by 2.7 percent. The transport, storage and communication industry increased by 7.7 percent. On an annual basis, South Africa’s economy grew by 0.8 percent in 2018, marginally above the forecast of some analysts. The World Bank expects the South African economy to expand by 1.3 percent in 2019.
