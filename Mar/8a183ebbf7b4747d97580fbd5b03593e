In a bid to become the leader in the international gold
business, Tanzania plans to launch its first ever international gold exchange in
Geita region in the North Western part of the country in April 2019 to attract
local and foreign dealers. The infrastructure needed for the first East African gold trading hub, including a one stop centre, is in place for the gold exchange to take off. All that is left is for the Ministry of Mining to give a confirmation for the opening of the market, Geita Regional Commissioner, Engineer Robert Gabriel said. The international gold bullion market is expected to attract more businesses like hotels, boost the shilling stability against the dollar, increase the use of the Chato and Mwanza Airports in the country as well as boost the earnings of the small-scale miners generated from gold mining activities, as well as maximize government revenues. According to the Federation of Miners Association of Tanzania (FEMATA), there are more than six million small scale miners across Tanzania. An estimated 40.5 million people were directly engaged in Artisanal and Small-scale Mining in 2017, up from 30 million in 2014, 13 million in 1999 and 6 million in 1993. In February, the President organized a meeting with the mining stakeholders to find solutions to their grievances as well as receive advice on how best the mining sector can be operated for the benefit of the country and its people. The outcome of the meeting led to the countyâ€™s parliament endorsing a bill to remove payment of 5 percent withholding tax and 18 percent value added tax imposed on small scale miners. Each of the five districts in the Geita region will have one centre for the collection of gold from small scale miners, and two banks where gold trading will be taking place for transactions to be conducted safely and securely.
