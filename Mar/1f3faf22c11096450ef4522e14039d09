Zimbabwe’s Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube expects the country’s annual inflation rate to drop below 10 percent by the year-end as the impact of reforms aimed at combating inflation starts to be felt. Year-on-year inflation rose from 56.9 percent in January to 59.4 percent in February, the highest annual level since hyperinflation more than a decade ago, statistics agency Zimstat said. However, the price of goods and services dropped by 1.67 percent month-on-month in February, down from 10.8 percent in January. According to Ncube, the downward trend maintained by the month-on-month inflation showed that his policies of restructuring and reforming Zimbabwe’s economy were beginning to be felt. “It is vital that economic agents, investors, consumers, and indeed policymakers focus their attention on month-on-month inflation developments rather than year-on-year,” Ncube said. “Monthly inflation in #Zimbabwe falls dramatically to 1.7 percent in February 2019, compared to 10.8 percent in January 2019. As projected in the economic reform programme, the Transitional Stabilisation Programme, monthly inflation should continue on a downward trend as reforms kick in,” Ncube said on Twitter. Backing up his reforms, Ncube said the social impact of the 2 percent electronic transfer tax which was introduced last October is now being felt in Zimbabwe where Cyclone Idai has  wreaked havoc with lives and properties lost to the disaster. According to Ncube, Zimbabweans can see their tax in action, as “the ministry of finance has released $50 million for Emergency and Infrastructure Restoration following Cyclone Idai-induced floods destruction and infrastructural damage across Zimbabwe”.
