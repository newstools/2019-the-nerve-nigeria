Former Ghanaian president, John Dramani Mahama, 60, has won the presidential ticket for Ghana’s main opposition party National Democratic Congress (NDC). He will be challenging 74-year-old incumbent president, Nana Akufo-Addo in next year’s election.  This will be the third face-off in three consecutive polls between both men. It would be recalled that in 2016, Akufo-Addo of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) unseated Mahama after his administration failed to address the country’s failing economy affected by fall in prices of gold and cocoa. Mahama’s administration also had a crippling energy crisis that resulted in routine 24-hour power cuts. The country also turned to the International Monetary Fund in 2015 for a bailout after a currency crisis increased the inflation rate to 20 percent and caused the government’s debt to soar. According to Reuters, Akufo-Addo, who is expected to stand for re-election as the candidate of the NPP, campaigned in 2016 on the promise to cut deficits following overspending by Mahama’s government. So far, he has presided over an economic recovery, with a growth of 6.7 percent in the first three-quarters of last year. Mahama previously served as president when he won the 2012 election against Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party, before losing to him in 2016. Ghana is the world’s second-largest cocoa producer, Africa’s number two gold producer and it began pumping oil off its coast in 2010. In Ghana, NDC and NPP have dominated the politics of the country since 1992.
