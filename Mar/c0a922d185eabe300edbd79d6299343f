The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has cut the country’s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 13.50 percent from  14 percent, while retaining other key parameters. This move which is the first rate cut in more than two years was made known during its second meeting in 2019 that held from February  25 to 26, 2019. According to the CBN  Governor, Godwin Emefiele, this decision is aimed at reducing the rate of unemployment and diversifying the country’s economy. The decision comes off the back of the release of the country’s inflation rate for the month of February 2019 which slumped 0.06 percent to 11.31 percent in February from 11.37 percent in January 2019, the lowest figure recorded in 14 months. “Sensibly cautious first move from the CBN. Keeping the naira expensive via high rates was understandable before elections .. but now a little easing on both is reasonable,” Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital commented on Twitter.
