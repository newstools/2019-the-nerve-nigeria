CFAO is taking advantage of Steinhoff Group’s quest for cash, to enter South Africa, the continent’s biggest car market in automotive retail. The French multinational is negotiating with the South African company for the acquisition of 74.9 percent of the issued share capital of its auto dealerships unit Unitrans Motor Holdings (Pty) Ltd. Steinhoff will dispose of its remaining 25.1 percent interest in Unitrans as part of a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment transaction, in line with its commitment to contribute to local economic growth. Unitrans runs one of South Africa’s largest auto showrooms and a network of trucks dealerships with annual sales of more than R23 billion ($1.6 billion), but Steinhoff, rocked by an accounting fraud of 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) which shocked investors and left the company struggling to get working capital, had to sell its stake in Unitrans to raise more funds. The retail group had earlier sold its 26 percent stake in South Africa’s KAP Industrial for $332 million. With more than 550,000 units sold in 2018, South Africa is the biggest African new car market, accounting for 45 percent of the units sold across the continent.“By intending to enter Africa’s biggest car market, CFAO sets a key milestone in its pan-African development and reinforces its South African footprint, currently constituted of procurement and logistic services to the local automotive industry,” said Richard Bielle CFAO’s Chairman and CEO. A statement by CFAO said that the completion of the transaction is subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement between the parties, as well as regulatory and third party approvals.
