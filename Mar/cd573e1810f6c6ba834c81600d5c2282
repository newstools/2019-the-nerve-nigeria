The Kingdom of Eswatini, a small, landlocked monarchy in southern Africa, previously known as Swaziland, has signed a financing agreement worth €1.2 million (over $1.36 million) with the European Union and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to construct a modern multi-purpose Trade Hub in Manzini, the country’s second largest urban centre behind Mbabane, with a population of 78,000. The modern multi-purpose Trade Hub to be constructed in Manzini is expected to accommodate 300 traders and impact over 400 businesses as well as enhance the performance of the leather value chain in the country, improve quality infrastructure services to support production and trade, raise the capacities for investment promotion in the country, and help the country attain the required economic transformation that would benefit the  Swazis. The over $1.36 million financing agreement will also be used to provide private sector support as well as help develop the micro, small and medium trade by improving the quality of products, marketing skills and find bigger markets. The country’s Minister of Finance, Neal Rijkenberg and the Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry Manqoba Khumalo signed the document on behalf of the Eswatini government while COMESA Secretary General Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe signed for COMESA. The Head of Cooperation at the European Union Office in Eswatini Ariane Labat signed for the EU. The signing ceremony was conducted in Ezulwini in Eswatini. According to the Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, “The construction of the Trade hub locally known as ‘INHLANGANISELA YABOMAKE’ will bring relief to the majority of handcraft artisans, most of whom currently operate in the open in backyards spread across the country. The new facility will also protect the artisans from unfavourable weather conditions which makes it difficult for them to operate.” Meanwhile, Secretary General Kapwepwe noted that “This project preserves the Kingdom’s unique culture by pulling on the knowledge of the gatekeepers of Eswatini traditions while applying modern technologies and designs that are attractive to an international market.”
