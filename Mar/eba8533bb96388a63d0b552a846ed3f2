Growth in investment and net exports, fiscal consolidation in several African countries, a modest recovery in commodity prices and decreasing inflation are some of the factors contributing to Africa’s positive economic outlook. However, as noted in the United Nations’ World Economic Situation and Prospects 2019 report, Africa’s GDP growth remains well below what is required to meet many of the targets associated with the Sustainable Development Goals and to keep pace with the continent’s high rate of population growth. This is according to a recent report by African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA) which analyses activities in the Private Equity (PE) sector across all the four regions in Africa.  According to AVCA, the total value of PE fundraising in Africa increased to $2.7 billion in 2018 from $2.4 billion in 2017, indicating investors’ confidence in Africa’s PE industry. Despite having an increase,  the total deal value decreased to $3.5 billion in 2018 from $3.9 billion in 2017 while the total value of African PE fundraising between 2013 and 2018 was $17.8 billion. The report also revealed that a total of 1,022 deals worth $25.7 billion took place from 2013 to 2018. While the value of PE deals dropped marginally in 2018 to $3.5 billion from $3.9 billion in 2017, the volume of PE deals reached a six-year peak of 186 in 2018 up from 171 in 2017. Between 2013 and 2018, 19 percent of the deals were from the Information Technology sector, 15 percent from Consumer Discretionary, and 13 percent from Consumer Staples. These sectors accounted for almost half of the total number of PE deals in 2018, while Communication Services (which includes deals in Telecommunication Services) was the largest sector by value. It is worthy to note that the share of PE deal volume of  Information Technology has grown significantly in recent years. This increase was mainly driven by growing deal activity in companies involved in the development of applications for the business and consumer market such as the investment in Cellulant, a pan-African payments company providing a one-stop digital payments platform. How the regions  fared The report also shed light on PE activity in Southern, West, North and East Africa, detailing the number and value of reported PE deals, as well as providing a breakdown by country. It also provided political, economic and regulatory contexts for key markets. Over the 2013 to 2018 period, Southern Africa attracted the largest number of PE deals at 294, while West Africa had the largest share of deals by value at $10.8 billion. Finally, North Africa had the largest median deal size at $8 million, while East, West and Southern Africa each had a median deal size of  $6 million over the same period. During the period under review, Southern Africa attracted the largest number of PE deals at 294 valued at $3.5 billion. South Africa accounted for 66 percent of the deal by volume followed by Zambia which accounted for 12 percent. However, Mauritius was after South Africa as the country with the second highest deal by value. Unlike Southern Africa which had the highest number of PE deals by volume, West Africa had the highest PE deals by value at $10.8 billion representing 282 deals. In the region, Nigeria had the highest deal by value and volume, followed by Ghana. The report revealed that an increase in the price of crude oil, improved foreign exchange reserves and the liquidity of countries in West Africa resulted in an improvement in the region’s economic environment in 2018. The outlook for 2019 remains positive as further growth is projected for the region. For Nigeria, there is also the key singular fact that there will be some stability from the second quarter of 2019, given that the elections have been concluded and a cabinet should soon be in place. North Africa had a total of 163 deals valued at $3.7 billion with Egypt accounting for the highest PE by value and volume followed by Morocco and Tunisia. In Egypt, Education has emerged as a significant sector in its PE industry. In 2018, EFG Hermes and GEMS Education’s joint education platform acquired four schools for EGP1 billion ($57.86 million).  The new investment law in Morroco set up in 2018 will give foreign investors more flexibility to transfer funds out of the country, and its establishment of a new investment fund will also help the launch and financing of infrastructure projects in marginalized areas. East Africa had 194 PE deals valued at $2.4 billion during the period under review. Kenya accounted for the highest number of PE by volume and value followed by Uganda. Surprisingly, Tanzania had 9 percent of PE by value followed by Ethiopia at 7 percent and Rwanda at 6 percent. Ethiopia, Tanzania and Djibouti recorded 11 percent, 9 percent, and 7 percent respectively, of PE by value in the region, with Rwanda accounting for only 3 percent. Private Equity Exits in Africa A total of 273 African PE reportedly exited between 2013 and 2018 but last year 46 PE exits were recorded in the continent as opposed to 52 recorded in 2017. This decrease was largely due to a fall in the number of exits recorded in South Africa (representing 20 percent of exit volume in 2018, compared to 42 percent from 2013 to 2017). In 2018, exits by trade buyers represented the most common exit route. This was followed by PE and other financial buyers at 37 percent with IPOs and capital market exits representing the lowest share of exits recorded.
