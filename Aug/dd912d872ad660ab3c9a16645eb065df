On August 16, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) noted that developers of income-generating digital applications and other online businesses will start paying tax. Meanwhile, the World Bank in a new report stated that Kenyan taxpayers are not getting the full value of the development projects that billions were spent on. According to the World Bank report, countries which run budgets have achieved more than Kenya as the weaknesses in project selection, procurement planning and implementation delays have driven public investment outcomes to a low. While analysing Kenya’s public expenditure, the World Bank stated that “Despite a ramp-up in development spending, public investment remains low relative to peer countries … there is scope for improvement on outcomes realised relative to inputs in terms of public spending in education, health and physical infrastructure,” says the World Bank. Currently, Kenya spends about 20 percent of its GDP and achieves only 0.17 percent growth in GDP per capita. This amounts to just a measure of how much each citizen would get if a country’s wealth is distributed equally and there is a likelihood that the $6.8 billion Kenya has set aside for development in the current financial year may not improve the lives of Kenyans as it would for some other country citizens. For taxpayers to get the value of their money, the World Bank proffers that the Kenyan government do a sector-by-sector deep-dive analysis to quantify exact amounts of Budget allocations that could be saved and potentially re-allocated to other projects
