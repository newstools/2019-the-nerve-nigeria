The ministerial list for the second term of President Muhamadu Buhari was yesterday sent to the Nigerian Senate for confirmation 54 days after been sworn in as president. The delay in having a minster was criticized by a lot of Nigerians who believed that since it was his second term, it would have been easier to nominate his ministers without so much delay. It would be recalled that prior to the release of this list president Buhari said that he would only nominate people well known to him as ministers. However to the surprise of many Nigerians the list of the ministers that was released is nothing to write home about as the president did not appoint Technocrats but rather the same set of people who are politically affiliated to the current administration or ruling party. This ministerial list was also marred with several issues ranging from not appointing a youth as minister to having only a few women in his cabinet,  0nly 7 out of 43 Nominees are women. One would question if the president has sworn never to have at least 40 percent women representation in his cabinet. Maybe he has also sworn not to have a youth as a minister in his cabinet after signing the not too young to run bill before his second term election. It will also amaze you to know that some names on the list have at one time been guest of the Â Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to answer charges on corruption while some others have pending corruption cases in court. The president did not also add a portfolio to their names in order to aid the screening process.
