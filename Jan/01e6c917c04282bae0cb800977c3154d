Nigeria’s Access Bank, which announced the acquisition of fellow Nigerian lender Diamond Bank Plc, has obtained approval in principle from the country’s central bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on proposed merger plans. According to Victor Etuokwu, Executive Director at Access Bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria and SEC have granted both banks approval in principle for the merger process. The banks are, however, awaiting the final approval which would be granted after convening shareholders’ meeting. In December, acquisition plans were made public after Access Bank disclosed that it would raise additional capital of $250 million in a merger deal with Diamond Bank Plc. Meanwhile, Diamond Bank had previously announced its decision to drop its international operating licence to focus on national operations following capitalization issues. The merger involves Access Bank acquiring the entire issued share capital of Diamond Bank in exchange for a combination of cash and shares in Access Bank via a Scheme of Merger. Based on the agreement reached by the Boards of the two financial institutions, Diamond Bank shareholders will receive a consideration of N3.13 per share, comprising of N1.00 per share in cash and the allotment of two New Access Bank ordinary shares for every seven Diamond Bank ordinary shares held as at the implementation date. Upon finalization of the merger, Diamond Bank would be absorbed into Access Bank and it will cease to exist under Nigerian law.
