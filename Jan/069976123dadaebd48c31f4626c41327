British mining firm, Gemfields is set to take responsibility for the human rights abuses committed at its Mozambique ruby mine, Fabergé by paying a total of $7.5 million in compensation. In April 2018, law firm Leigh Day issued proceedings at a High Court in London against Gemfields. In the legal claims, about 300 people living near the Montepuez mine in Northern Mozambique which is owned by Gemfields Mozambican subsidiary, complained that private security guards and security personnel in Mozambique had shot, beaten, sexually abused and unlawfully detained them. Gemfields denies any responsibility for abuses but admits instances of violence have occurred at the mine. “We recognise that in the past instances of violence have occurred on and off the MRM licence area, both before and after our arrival in Montepuez,” the company said. “Where such incidents have occurred, including instances involving our own employees, MRM has taken decisive and appropriate steps, working closely with the authorities, including providing humanitarian assistance to artisanal miners and community members,” it added. The miner which describes itself as the leading supplier of responsibly sourced coloured gemstones noted that a panel of independent experts will consider any future grievance cases. In addition to the compensation, the company has also agreed to set up an agriculture and skills training fund for the local community where it operates. Gemfields owns Fabergé and holds additional stakes in companies based in Zambia, Mozambique, Ethiopia and Madagascar. It also has minority stakes in platinum-group metals producer Sedibelo Platinum Mines Limited and a steelmaking materials producer Jupiter Mines Limited.
