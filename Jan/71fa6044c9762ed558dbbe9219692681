On Wednesday, January 16, 2019, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released Nigeria’s inflation rate for the month of December 2018. According to the data released the rate increased by 0.16 percent to 11.44 percent in December from 11.28 percent in November 2018 and 15.37 percent in December 2017.  These increases were recorded in all Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) divisions that yielded the Headline index. Food inflation, which is derived from the Food composite index, increased to 13.56 percent from 13.30 percent recorded in November. The rise in the index was caused by increases in prices of soft drinks, Fish, Bread and Cereals, Oils and fats, Coffee, tea and cocoa, Meat, Milk, Cheese and egg, Vegetables, Potatoes, yam and other tubers. The Core inflation or  ”all items less farm produce” which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce stood at 9.8 percent in December 2018 (same as the figure recorded in November 2018). According to the report, the highest increases were recorded in the prices of Domestic services and household services, Dental services, Garments, Narcotics, major household appliances whether electronic or not, Medical services, Cleaning, repair and hire of clothing and Tobacco. How states fared At the state level, the highest rates were recorded Bayelsa (13.32 percent), Zamfara (13.23 percent) and Ekiti (13.18 percent), while Kwara (9.12 percent) Ogun (8.71 percent), and Cross River (8.21 percent) recorded the slowest rise in headline Year on Year inflation. On a month on month basis, the highest rate recorded were in Kebbi (1.72 percent), Kaduna (1.69 percent), and Zamfara (1.68 percent), while Ogun (0.07 percent) had the least with Kwara and Edo recording negative inflation or price deflation on a month on month all item basis in December 2018. During the same period, food inflation on a year on year basis was highest in Abuja (16.50 percent), Bayelsa (16.23 percent) and Nasarawa (16.15 percent), while Oyo (10.79 percent), Cross River (10.57 percent) and Ogun (10.46 percent) recorded the slowest rise. What this means and what should be expected Following the increase in inflation rate, the interest rate could be left unchanged at the next Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting scheduled to take place between January 21 and  22, 2019. Since this is an electioneering year, it is also expected that inflation would increase further as politicians and government at all levels increase spending.
