Public hearings into allegations of corruption at the state-owned Public Investment Corporation (PIC) with R2.083 trillion ($150 Billion) of assets under management began on Monday. President Cyril Ramaphosa had last October set up the judicial Commission of Inquiry chaired by former Supreme Court of Appeal president Judge Lex Mpati to investigate allegations of impropriety following reports of poor governance and precarious investment processes in the company which is Africa’s largest investment manager. But the first two witnesses, who are leading executives told the commission that they did not witness impropriety as alleged. Mpati urged people with information that can help the commission to come forward, assuring them of necessary protection. The PIC is the only investment management company in South Africa that focuses exclusively on the public sector, with 88 percent of the assets it manages held on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund (GPEF). The commission’s terms of reference include a review of the PIC’s governance and operating model, possible changes to the PIC’s founding legislation and its Memorandum of Incorporation and investment decision-making framework. The commission is required to provide the President with an interim report by February and submit a final report and recommendations by April 2019.
