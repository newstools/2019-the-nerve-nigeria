In the first three quarters of 2018, Kenya imported 134,000 tonnes of used clothing worth Sh12.74 billion. This is a new record from the 101,066 tonnes worth Sh8.3 billion imported in 2013. In the three quarters of 2017, Sh9.8 billion was spent to import 102,781 tonnes of used clothes, a 12.2 percent increase from the 21.3 percent imports recorded in the same period in 2018. According to the UN Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade), the global trade in used clothes has grown steadily in the last one and a half decades, with worldwide exports reaching $4.8 billion in 2015. The bulk of which was imported by East Africa.  The East African Community accounts for about 12.5 percent of global imports of used clothing. East Africa imported $274 million worth of used clothes and shoes in 2015 and the bulk of it was imported by Kenya. As of 2015, Kenya was sub-Saharan Africa’s top destination with 2.2 percent ($95 million) of global import. In 2016, Kenya’s imports of used clothing increased by 23 percent amounting to $124 million an equivalent of six thousand 40-foot containers carrying 144 thousand metric tons of clothes.  The cotton, textiles and apparel (CTA) industry is the second biggest manufacturing activity in Kenya, providing livelihood to approximately 200 thousand households. Unfortunately, the country still imports used clothing.  Oxfam, a British charity that sells used clothes that were donated by people to Africans, noted that at least 70 percent of used clothing donated by people end up in Africa. Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) textiles and apparel sector officer, Abel Kamau stated that “The imports are high but the biggest threat to local new clothes manufacturing is illicit trade that is hurting local sales. We are happy with the ongoing war on illicit trade which must be sustained to help big, small and medium enterprises that produce finished apparels to benefit from a growing appetite for new clothes.” Following the high imports and the threats to clothing businesses, the East African Community head of states (comprising Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan) had agreed in 2016 to ban the import of used clothes and footwear in the region by 2019. The ban was part of the EAC’s vision 2050 and the Industrialization Policy to enhance manufacturing sector that currently contributes 8.7 percent of the regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP). That year, Rwanda increased duties on used clothing from the United States from $0.25 to $2.50 per kilogram. However, early 2018 saw countries like Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya chicken out of the pact after the United States, backed by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) threatened to cut East African countries from the Act for non-compliance. Presently, the used clothing industry creates an estimated 355,000 jobs among the East African Community, generating over $230 million in income that supports an estimated 1.4 million people. In addition to jobs, the import duties and value-added tax (VAT) paid to EAC governments by importers of used clothing result in over $140 million in estimated annual revenues, data from the USAID’s East Africa’s Investment hub reveals. To enable small and medium clothing manufacturers to thrive in Kenya as well as balance the competition, KAM is soliciting for blanket taxation worth about Sh2 million for a 20-foot container and Sh4 million for a 40-foot container of finished textiles and apparels. “Kenya should pursue 100 percent verification of all textile imports and enhance surveillance on porous borders where punitive action should be taken against unscrupulous traders using these routes to bring in contraband apparel products,” Kamau stated. He added that 22 foreign-owned finished apparel factories operate at various Export Processing Zones in Kenya and they exported clothes worth Sh36 billion, largely to America and Europe. There are 170 local medium and large textile companies. Kamau said local retail chains need to give local clothmakers a platform to sell products instead of selling imports. Meanwhile, the USAID’s East Africa’s Investment hub suggests that a reduction or elimination of imports of used clothing would have no effect on the development of the local industry.
