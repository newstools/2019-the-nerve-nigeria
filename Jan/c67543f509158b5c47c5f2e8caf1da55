Egypt plans to upgrade six of its eight oil refineries over four years to increase domestic production to 41 million tonnes a year, the petroleum minister said in Cairo on Sunday night. The upgrade will cost the country about $9 billion. “We are trying to secure crude oil supplies for Egyptian refineries to increase local production of refined products,” Tarek El Molla said. Egypt’s eight refineries has a capacity of 38 million tonnes, but only 25 million tonnes are utilised. Egypt’s crude oil reserves dropped to about 3 billion barrels in 2018 from about 4 billion in 2015, as a result of the country’s failure to achieve significant oil discoveries in recent years. A source in the country’s oil sector told Daily News Egypt last year that Egypt imports 32-35 percent of its monthly needs of fuel, to bridge the gap between domestic production and consumption. The imports come from government agreements signed by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) with several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, and Iraq’s Sumo. source: tradingeconomics.com
