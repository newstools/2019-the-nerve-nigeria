Senegal’s President Macky Sall, yesterday inaugurated the first section of the Regional Express Train (Train Express Régional, or TER) that will link Senegal’s capital city Dakar to Diamniadio in line with plans when work started in December 2016. The TER is a flagship element of the Plan for an Emerging Senegal policy framework. The Emerging Senegal Plan launched in 2014 is aimed at promoting the economic and social development of the West African country. “Very pleased to inaugurate the TER, an important project of our infrastructure policy. Combined with other projects, it is a revolution in our long distance mobility, for the well-being of Senegalese and Senegalese,” President Sall wrote on Twitter following the inauguration on Monday. APIX, the Senegalese State investment and public works agency, had in 2016 selected ENGIE and Thales to design and build systems and infrastructures for the new Dakar Regional Express Train in a contract valued at €225 million ($257.8 million) and expected to be completed in 26 months. Working with APIX and other partners, the companies are tasked with the design and construction of rail electrification, revenue collection, signalling, and telecommunication systems. When the second section of the project is completed in 2020, the Regional Express Train will link Dakar to the new Blaise Diagne International Airport in 45 minutes, through 14 stations and 55 km of track. Senegal had last year received shipment of 15 Coradia Polyvalent trains from French multinational rail transport company Alstom. The 15 trains will help satisfy the increasing need for mobility in Dakar and will run on the new line connecting the centre of the city to the new Blaise Diagne International Airport. The number of daily passengers is expected to be up to 115,000.
