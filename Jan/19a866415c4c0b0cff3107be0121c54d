Kenya’s national carrier, Kenya Airways has announced plans to launch flights from Nairobi to Rome, Italy and Geneva in June 2019, as the airline seeks to expand its base and improve revenue. The national carrier which is targeting travellers visiting European countries has said that the flights to the new destinations will be serviced by the carrier’s Boeing 787 Dreamliner four times a week. “The addition of flights to Rome and Geneva will be welcomed by both our leisure and business customers,” Kenyan Airways chief executive Sebastian Mikosz stated. He also added that “Rome with its status of a ‘global city’ is also rich with history and culture making it one of the top tourist destination in the world while Geneva hosts the highest number of international organisations in the world such as the United Nations (UN), making it a global hub for diplomacy.” Previously, Kenya Airways operated flights to Rome, but in June 2012, the carrier announced the suspension of services as part of its cost-cutting measures following a 50 percent fall in profit for the 2011/12 financial year. The resumption of the flights to Rome and the addition of Geneva will bring Kenya Airways European destinations to five and 55 worldwide, including a direct flight to New York from Nairobi. “With this route, Kenya Airways will offer excellent connections from these two cities to its 43 destinations in Africa for business, diplomatic missions, and tourism,” Mikosz said. Kenya Airways saw its net losses decline by 28.8 percent to Ksh4 billion ($40 million) in the half year ended June 2018 due to the cost-cutting measures introduced, as well as policies aimed at revenue growth.
