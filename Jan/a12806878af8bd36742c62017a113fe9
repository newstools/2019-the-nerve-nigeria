PZ Cussons has seen shares tumble by up to 13 percent after it released a profit warning warning over profits, as woes mount in its Nigerian business. The warnings came as PZ Cussons reported a 20.3 percent fall in statutory pre-tax profits to £26.7 million for the six months to November 30. Underlying pre-tax profits are now expected to be “towards” £70 million ($91.5 million), down from £80.1 million ($104.7 million) a year earlier. “The macroeconomic conditions in Nigeria remain extremely challenging and continue to have a significant negative impact on overall group performance,” said Caroline Silver, chairwoman of PZ Cussons. Silver said the company is working on initiatives to “streamline our portfolio of activities and limit exposure to volatility in Nigeria”. According to the group, profits are being hurt by economic troubles in Nigeria, with wages lagging behind spiralling cost inflation in recent years, as well as an estimated £5.5 million from significant port disruption in the country. PZ Cussons said its performance in Nigeria is being hit further by higher supply-chain costs and a lower exchange rate, which has led to lower prices, volumes and margins. The company, however, said despite Brexit uncertainty in the UK, performance in the UK was good overall, with the region’s half-year underlying earnings up 1.7 percent at £24.6 million. Nigeria has been a challenging economy for PZ Cussons for years. The company had a difficult 2017/2018 financial year, as well as a bad Q1 2018/2019. However, half-year 2018/19 results showed a massive improvement in the company’s bottom line, largely due to cost-cutting. PZ said it will prioritise key product categories in Nigeria until growth returns to the market.
