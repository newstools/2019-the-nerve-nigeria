Mozambique’s tax Authority, Autoridade Tributária de Moçambique (AT) said it would relieve state-owned companies of their debt, totaling MZN9 billion ($146.48 million) to enable debtor entities alleviate their tax burdens as well as give the Tax Authority an extension of the revenue collection margin. Amélia Nakhare, president of AT said the tax authority will forgive fines, interest and taxes due from state-owned companies. However, the debt relief does not include the net debt of the companies as failure to pay the net debt will attract tax enforcement. As at May 2018, 20 of the 107 public and state-partnered companies in Mozambique were in financial crisis, with the total liabilities of six of the these companies amounting to over MZN 156.9 billion and the short-term debt to national banks amounting MZN 27.2 billion ($442.14 million), investigations by A Verdade reveal. The debtors including TV de Mozambique (TVM), Eletricidade de Mocambique Mozambique Airports and Mozambique Electricity-EDM, Mocambique Celular, Mozambique Airlines (LAM), Mozambican Telecommunications (TDM), Mozambique Cellular (MCel), Petróleos de Moçambique (Petromoc), Mozambique Airports and Mozambique Electricity (EDM). A Verdade discovered LAM owed MZN4.1 billion ($66.65 million), MCel MZN10.3 billion ($167.43 million), Petromoc MZN15 billion (243.83 million), MZN7.8 billion ($126.79 million) in TDM, MZN7.9 billion ($128.42 million) in Airports and MZN32.5 billion ($528.29 million) in EDM. Prior to the debt relief, the International Monetary had recommended a restructuring of public enterprises in difficulty. According to the IMF, the financial crisis in state-owned enterprises generated less taxes for the state, with deferral of payment to avoid bankruptcy, and is a risk to national banking. The debt of the top 10 state-owned companies increased 47 percent in 2016, contaminating other public and private companies and the private sector.
