An emerging markets-focused solar finance business SunFunder has provided $2 million debt facility for SolaWorks!, a Mozambique-based pay-as-you-go solar home system and energy service company. “Based on their performance, strong management, and impressive group of investors, we see that SolarWorks! is a company with the potential to scale up while improving the lives of tens of thousands of Mozambican families in the coming years,” said Avi Jacobson, Senior Investment Officer, who led the transaction for SunFunder. The investment was done using an innovative multi-currency approach  by collaborating with the currency hedging company MFX Solutions. It will be used primarily as working capital to accelerate SolarWorks!’s growth in Mozambique. This is also SunFunder and MFX’s first transaction in Mozambique. “We are excited to be able to support this transaction which allows SolarWorks! to expand its vitally-needed solar services to households in Mozambique without taking on the burden of foreign currency debt. With few options for local financing, renewable energy companies in frontier markets need to rely on external capital which can be risky if the local currency depreciates. By integrating MFX’s hedging services into its lending model, SunFunder was able to offer the Mozambican metical (MZN) financing that SolarWorks! needs without increasing its own risk. Going forward, we think hedging can be an important part of meeting the financing needs of renewable energy companies in Southern Africa and beyond,” said Brian Cox, CEO of MFX Solutions. Mozambique has been grappling with power shortage for over a decade  and this hindered the growth of the country. Although the electrification rate has increased from 5 percent in 2001 to 26 percent in 2016, access to electricity still remains low. About 70 percent of its population lives in rural areas out of which only 5.7 percent use electricity for lighting. The national grid including off-grid facilities is claimed to reach about 30 percent of the country’s population with potential access to electricity. Many district capitals rely on expensive and often unreliable power generation like diesel generators.  The overwhelming majority of rural households,  rural schools, health centres and administrative posts are currently without access to electricity.  There is also a limited availability of debt capital to support off-grid solar solutions. SunFunder and MFX Solutions expect the financing to directly impact the lives of 65,000 people with improved energy access and in the process displace at least 26 tonnes of CO2 emissions. “We are very proud to have closed this facility as we really appreciate SunFunder’s vision of aiming for long-term partnerships. The potential in our region is enormous so partners like SunFunder are of crucial importance in order to have large-scale impact on millions of people’s lives and at the same time deliver good financial returns for our finance partners,” Arnoud de Vroomen, CEO and co-founder of SolarWorks!, added. In October 2018, SolarWorks! raised €2m from the world leader in renewable energy EDP. This raise which was used for expansion in South Africa was preceded by a 2017 seed grant reception from the GSMA under the Mobile for Development Utilities Innovation Fund.
