Africa’s leading pay-TV business with local and international content offering, MultiChoice Group (MCG) is expected to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) on Wednesday, February 27, 2019, a pre-listing statement issued by MCG after markets closed on Monday showed. MultiChoice said it will list on the “broadcasting and entertainment” sector of the South African Bourse. “We believe the listing of MultiChoice provides an excellent opportunity to invest in the leading provider of video entertainment on the African continent. MCG brings an incomparable local and international content offering to around 14-million households and is one of the fastest growing pay-TV broadcast providers globally. With strong financials, the flexibility of an ungeared balance sheet and deep local knowledge, we hope to deliver excellent returns to shareholders over time,” Calvo Mawela, Group Chief Executive Officer of MCG said in a statement. MCG also said that there would be a focus on returning its loss-making operations outside of South Africa to profitability. It would do this by making content affordable to more consumers, accelerating subscriber acquisition through competitive set-top box offers, investing in a world-class retention capability and in customer service and delivery. Naspers had last year announced plans to list its video services as a separate business on the JSE, with the name MultiChoice Group, which will include MultiChoice South Africa, MultiChoice Africa, Showmax Africa, and Irdeto. “Listing MultiChoice Group via an unbundling aims to unlock value for Naspers shareholders and at the same time create an empowered, top 40 JSE-listed African entertainment company,” said Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk. The MCG spin-off will see Naspers distribute 438,837,468 shares to investors recorded on the Naspers securities register. By this, any investor holding Naspers shares as of 26 February, would receive shares in MultiChoice through a pro rata distribution in specie. According to Naspers, the shares will be unbundled at the close of trade on Friday, March 1, with shareholders receiving one MultiChoice share for every one ordinary ’N’ share and for every five ‘A’ ordinary shares held. “This is an exciting time for both Naspers and our shareholders. The unbundling of MCG will complete Naspers’ evolution into a global consumer internet company while also creating the opportunity for our shareholders to own a stake directly in MultiChoice Group, a unique African success story,” Bob van Dijk said in a statement. Founded 30 years ago, MultiChoice has grown to reach around 14 million households in 50 African countries, offering both paid-TV products and a fledgeling streaming service called ShowMax. As of March 31, 2018, the group generated more than R47bn in revenue and reported an operating profit of R6bn. However, it is worthy to note that MultiChoice’s success depends on customers having enough disposable income to pay for the cost of the subscription.
