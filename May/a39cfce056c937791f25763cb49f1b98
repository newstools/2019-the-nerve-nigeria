The demands for a successful transition to a civil government, among other things, are still being decided upon by Sudan’s army and a coalition of activists and opposition political groups, the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces. However, the source of legislation is still a bone for contention as both parties disagree on the country’s guiding principle. Following the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir in April, the protesters have made various demands, which was handed over to the interim government as a list of proposals. However, the ten-member Transitional Military Council (TMC) stated that it had many reservations about their proposals. Currently, Sudan’s constitution specifies that Sharia is the country’s guiding principle but activists say the sharia law was used to target women. Even some women’s rights organisations say thousands of women were flogged for indecent behaviour in the country. Protesters had proposed that the power to declare a state of emergency should lie with the cabinet and the transitional period last for four years but the military believes the Islamic Sharia law and tradition should be the source of legislation and the transitional period be two years. According to Lt-Gen Shamseddine Kabbashi, spokesman for the Transitional Military Council, “the declaration failed to mention the sources of legislation, and the Islamic Sharia law and tradition should be the source of legislation and our view is that Islamic Sharia and the local norms and traditions in the Republic of Sudan should be the sources of legislation.” Sudanese are still organising peaceful protests/ sit-in Khartoum, demanding the full dismantling of the “deep state” left behind by the ousted leader and the protesters’ leaders on Wednesday, May 8, called for civil disobedience. Meanwhile, Kabbashi noted that the military would consider holding early elections within six months.
