Nigerian aviation workers are threatening to boycott activities in the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) nationwide due to its inability to address the “sundry issues” raised before it. This was made known in a circular signed by Comrades Ocheme Aba, Frances Akinjole, Abdul Rasaq Saidu, Umoh Ofonime for National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP) and the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), respectively. According to the circular, the ministry of transport (aviation) has completely rejected the ultimatum, while the NCAA has reacted with only half-hearted measures. This means that no single item on the demands list has been ameliorated. Some of the demands of the unions included the immediate implementation of the new organogram for NCAA as agreed by the ministry, the management of NCAA and the unions. Others are the immediate review of the conditions of service as negotiated with the management by the agency’s leadership and the inauguration of the Governing Board of NCAA as directed by the government in 2018. The unions purported that at the expiration of the ultimatum on Monday, the ministry and the management of NCAA had failed to address any of the demands raised, threatening that the agency would remain grounded until the issues were addressed. It insisted that there was no going back on the impending grounding of activities in the regulatory agency in particular and the country’s civil aviation industry in general unless if the government immediately implemented the new organogram for NCAA as agreed by the ministry, the management of NCAA and the unions. If this issue is not resolved as soon as possible, Nigeria could lose billions of dollars over the shutdown of the airports. A lot of flight will also be delayed or cancelled.
