According to the report, Nigeria’s economy grew by 2.01 percent in Q1 2019 which is a 0.12 percent increase from the figure of Q1 in 2018. The report which talked about both the nominal and real GDP also revealed that relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, the real GDP growth rate declined by -0.38 percent.

What a GDP of 2.01 percent means for NigeriaAccording to Andrew S. Nevin, Advisory Partner and Chief Economist at PWC, for a number of years now Nigerians have been getting poorer and poorer per capita, as the growth of GDP is below the population growth of 2.7 percent per annum. The country grew 2.7 percent in GDP in 2015, meaning there is no growth in GDP per capita. In 2016, the GDP shrank and grew below population growth in 2017 and 2018. Now the country begins 2019 with its GDP growth below population growth again, and Q1 2019 GDP growth of 2.01 percent is a decline from the growth in Q4 2018. “Nigeria cannot continue with GDP growth below population and we urgently need policies and approaches that allow us to grow GDP at 6-8 percent per annum in an inclusive way. Only at 6-8 percent growth can we reduce the number of poor Nigerians significantly and start to tackle the immense challenge of youth unemployment in the country,” said Nevin. What needs to be doneNevin further said that some of the policies that PwC Nigeria would like Nigeria to consider include: a. Reforming the Land Use Act so we see a much more robust real estate sector and tackle the 17m housing deficit b. Decentralizing the power approach so the power crisis can be addressed at the local and state level; new technologies (including off-grid solar) provide many more options to produce electricity at a reasonable cost according to local conditions c. Unifying the exchange rate so that foreign investors are not confused and the potential for abusing the FX system is eliminated. In addition, states would receive more Naira from the Federal Allocation, alleviating some of the difficulties in paying State salaries d. Eliminating the fuel subsidy and channelling the savings into infrastructure, healthcare, and education e. Passing some form of the PIB so that investment starts to flow again to oil and gas; as part of this NNPC should consider structural changes clarify its roles as a regulator and its roles as an operator. In addition to these structural changes, PwC Nigeria would like the Federal and State Governments to consider a more active and strategic approach to the Nigerian Diaspora. This is because remittances from the diaspora are estimated at $25 billion in 2019 for the official flow. These are Nigerians largest flow of FX, and the Nigerian diaspora is large and very successful. Better engagement with the diaspora would result in a flow back to Nigeria both in resources for investment and also skills and capabilities to help build Nigeria.
