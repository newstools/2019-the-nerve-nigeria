Barely a year after the acquisition of defunct Diamond Bank, Access Bank is about to expand its footprint across Africa with the acquisition of 93.57 percent stake in Transnational Bank Limited of Kenya. This deal makes Access Bank the third Nigerian lender after Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) and United Bank of Africa (UBA) to set up operations in the country. Just like Diamond, Transnational which lends mainly to the agricultural sector has been recording losses. In 2018 it had a full-year pretax loss of 98.5 million shillings ($951,690), a 0.5 percent increase in loans to 6.63 billion shillings and non-performing loans ballooned  58 percent to 1.85 billion shillings. During the weekend Access Bank reported a significantly improved performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which shows that its merger with Diamond Bank is yielding a positive result. According to the bank, it recorded 44 percent growth in profit after tax (PAT), from  N62.9 billion in 2018 to N90.7 billion in 2019. Its net interest income soared to N210 billion, compared with N123 billion in 2018. Deposits increased from N2.56 trillion in 2018 to N4.24 trillion in 2019, while Total assets soared to N6.58 trillion in 2019 from N4.942 trillion in the corresponding year. So far, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has given Access Bank the approval to take over the bank as part of its move to consolidate Kenya’s banking Industry. Kenya has more banks per person than South Africa and Nigeria, Africa’s two largest economies. This deal also follows the acquisition of National Bank of Kenya Ltd and  KCB Group Ltd, and the merger of Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd. and NIC Group Plc. It would also be recalled that  Mauritius Based SBM Holdings Ltd. acquired some of the assets of Chase Bank Kenya Ltd. and the entire capital of Fidelity Commercial Bank Ltd. In Nigeria, Access Bank has acquired two banks, Intercontinental Bank and Diamond Bank which have made it become the largest African bank by assets. Looking at the Bank’s strategy, it always wants to be a dominant player in any market where it finds itself, in view of this there is a huge possibility that it would acquire more stakes in the Kenyan banking sector.
