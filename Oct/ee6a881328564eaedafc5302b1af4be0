Nigeria’s third-largest oil producer, Chevron wants to sell off some of its oilfields in Nigeria where local producers have expanded their presence in order to focus on projects including US shale and the Permian Basin.   This move which is part of its global drive to reshape its portfolio was made known to Reuters by oil and gas industry and banking sources. Chevron now joins foreign oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil in the drive to reduce their footprint in Nigeria. It is also in a race to be the first to pump a million barrels of shale oil a day from the field in the U.S. southwest, using a strategy that depends on a host of partners sharing their expertise and their output. Chevron has been shedding its assets globally and expects to sell up to $10 billion worth of properties to focus on projects including the Permian, where it has controlled some of the best and cheapest acreage since the 1920s. Chevron’s Permian production of oil, natural gas and associated liquids hit 16.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2018. This is not new as the IOCs such as Shell, Total, Chevron, and Eni in the past years have successfully disposed of stakes in some onshore and shallow water assets in Nigeria. In February 2015, Chevron Nigeria sold  22.5 percent working interest in OML 55 to Nigeria’s Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc. In Nigeria, Chevron holds and operates a 40 percent interest in 8 blocks in the onshore and near-onshore regions of the Niger Delta. This is under a joint venture with Nigeria’s National Petroleum Company (NNPC). In 2018, its production in the country reached 194,000 barrels of crude oil per day, 233 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 6,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) per day. Chevron has deep experience developing LNG operations. The company is behind the massive Gorgon and Wheatstone projects in Australia and has a stake in the Angola LNG, according to its website.
