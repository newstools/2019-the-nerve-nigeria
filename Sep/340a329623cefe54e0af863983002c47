In June 2019, hundreds of Sudanese were injured, over 60 people killed and scores went missing in the deadliest attack since Sudan began its sit-in protest in the military headquarters in the capital, Khartoum. Three months and several protests later, the country’s Attorney General, Abdallah Ahmed Abdallah, has issued a decision to set up a committee to investigate the disappearance of protesters. On June 3, gunmen dressed in the military fatigue of the Rapid Support Forces and the police stormed the sit-in, shooting and beating the pro-democracy protesters who have been camped outside Khartoum since April 6, 2019, before the former president, Omar al-Bashir, was overthrown after ruling the country for 30 years. Following the June 3 event, hundreds of people rallied in parts of the country in July, to demand an independent investigation. Thankfully, their demands have been heard and a committee set up. The Committee will be headed by the director of public prosecutions and will include two prosecutors along with representatives of the Bar Association, the police, the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Justice, and the Unit to combat violence against women. According to the official news agency SUNA, the committee shall probe all the allegations concerning the mysterious disappearance of missing persons from the sit-in during or after the brutal raid and the committee responsible has to submit a report about its findings within two months. This report is outside the regular progress reports on the implementation of its mission that the committee is to release. However, a recent report released on 14 September by a civil society group called ’Missing’ put the number of missing protesters at 21 people.
